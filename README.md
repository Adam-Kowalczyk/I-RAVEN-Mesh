# I-RAVEN Dataset
To fix the defacts of RAVEN dataset, we generate an alternative answer set for each RPM question in RAVEN, forming an improved dataset named Impartial-RAVEN (I-RAVEN for short). The comparison between the two datasets is shown below. For more details, please refer to our paper.

## Dataset Generation
Code to generate the dataset resides in the ```I-RAVEN``` folder. The dependencies are consistent with [the original RAVEN](https://github.com/WellyZhang/RAVEN).
* Python 2.7
* OpenCV
* numpy
* tqdm 
* scipy
* pillow

See ```I-RAVEN/requirements.txt``` for a full list of packages required. To install the dependencies, run
```
pip install -r I-RAVEN/requirements.txt
```
To generate a dataset, run
```
python I-RAVEN/main.py --num-samples <number of samples per configuration> --save-dir <directory to save the dataset>
```
Check the ```I-RAVEN/main.py``` file for a full list of arguments you can adjust.

Code of our model resides in the ```SRAN``` folder. The requirements are listed as follows:

* Python 3.7
* CUDA
* PyTorch
* torchvision
* scipy 1.1.0
* Visdom

See ```SRAN/requirements.txt``` for a full list of packages required. To install the dependencies, run
```
pip install -r SRAN/requirements.txt
```

To view training results, run ```python -m visdom.server -p 9527``` and click the URL [http://localhost:9527](http://localhost:9527).


To train and evaluate the model, run
```
python SRAN/main.py --dataset <I-RAVEN or PGM> --dataset_path <path to the dataset> --save <directory to save the checkpoint>
```

Check the ```SRAN/main.py``` file for a full list of arguments you can adjust.
